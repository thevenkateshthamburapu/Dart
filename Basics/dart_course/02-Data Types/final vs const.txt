final vs const keyword:
	If you never want to change a value then use final or const keywords.
		final name = “Sai Gopi”
		const price = 999

Difference between final and const :
final variable can only be set once and it is initialized when accessed.
const variable is implicitly final but it is a compile time constant
I.e it is initialized during the compilation.
Instance variable can be final but cannot be const
If you want a Class level constant then make it static const.
