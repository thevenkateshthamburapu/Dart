Dart Identifiers:
================
Identifiers are the name which is used to define variables, methods, class, and function, etc. An Identifier is a sequence of the letters([A to Z],[a to z]), digits([0-9]) and underscore(_), but remember that the first character should not be a numeric. There are a few rules to define identifiers which are given below.

The first character should not be a digit.
Special characters are not allowed except underscore (_) or a dollar sign ($).
Two successive underscores (__) are not allowed.
The first character must be alphabet(uppercase or lowercase) or underscore.
Identifiers must be unique and cannot contain whitespace.
They are case sensitive. The variable name Joseph and joseph will be treated differently.

Below is the table of valid and invalid identifiers.
